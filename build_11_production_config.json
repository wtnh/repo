(Ford had already sidestepped AMA ban on racing and was supplying engines and tech to Carroll Shelby, who was busy building Cobras.)

    "fact1": "A rare and highly influential Czechoslovakian luxury car, with forward-thinking engineering and hand-built in limited numbers",
    "fact2": "Much of engine, suspension and body made of lightweight magnesium.",
    "fact3": "Rear placement of motor reduced frontal area and allowed for a flat cabin floor.",
    "fact4": "The air-cooled motor was ventilated by inlets behind the rear side windows and belt-driven “squirrel fans” at the motor; louvres in the rear deck let hot air out.",
    "fact5": "Flowing body had a low drag coefficient of 0.245, and was refined with scale models in a wind tunnel.",
    "fact6": "With so much weight in the rear, car was very “tail happy” and rather unstable.",
    "fact7": "T77 inspired subsequent car design, most notably VW “Beetle”; in fact, after three decades, Tatra won a design infringement lawsuit against Volkswagen",
    "fact8": "Restored by Andy Simo and became known as The Million Dollar Tatra.",

    "fact1": "HEADLINE — A car born from a crash.",
    "fact2": "FACTS — Sprint Zagatos dominated every race and hillclimb in which they were entered, winning the World Sports Car GT 1.3 liter Championship in 1962 and ’63. Despite being a low-production numbers sports racer, they were available from any Alfa Romeo agent.",
    "fact3": "STORIES — In 1956 the Leto Di Priolo brothers asked Zagato to create a new, ultra-lite body for the Giulietta Sprint Veloce they’d just crashed in the Mille Miglia. The resulting custom body was 320 lbs. lighter, and subsequent copies drew customers away from Alfa Romeo. So Alfa commissioned Zagato to create a production version.",
    "fact4": "DESIGN/AESTHETICS — Designed by Ercole Spada, the SZ’s hand-formed aluminum body wrapped around a chassis of thin steel rods. This coda tonda or “round tail” body shed weight by having a spartan interior, plastic side windows and no bumpers.",
    "fact5": "INSIGHT — This car was restored in 2006, and donated by Barron G. Collier II in 2023. While it does not have a race history, it’s a great example of bold Zagato styling at the height of sports car racing in the 60s.",
