This repository contains the master configuration file for the Revs CarPad app.

The current CarPad configuration file is repo/build_11_production_config.json

All configuration edits should now be done only on this file. The others are deprecated.

The current working version in Android Studio is 2.5 (as of Nov 28 2023)

Do not use Version 3.0 - strictly experimental at this point!

Caution - do not update Android Studio or Gradle for project version 2.5 - it may break certain features.

For the 7" Lenovo tablets, edit activity_main.xml to adjust main screen spacing - see notes in file header.
